So basically I have a function that can speak a randomly assigned name aloud.
I'm using it to tell me when my code has finished running.

To use this you need to put the NameOutput.nb file into your directory,
compile it, then add the lines:

Get["GetNameFunction"];
SpeakName;

to any code you want this feature on.
